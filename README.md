# Functional Rupees

These are 8 fully functional and collectable rupees from The Legend of Zelda.

When you touch them, they'll give you the corresponding amount of rupees they would give you in game as health (-10 for rupoor, 1 for green, 5 for blue, 20 for red, 50 for purple, 100 for silver, 200 for orange and 300 for gold).

Whenever a player or NPC dies, it can drop rupees, depending on it's own maximal health. These dropped rupees will also despawn after some time, with a neat animation.
Rupees can also give armor instead of health, amount which can be capped.
You can configure all these settings under the "Options" tab in the upper-right corner of the spawnmenu, under "Stuff", "Functional Rupees".

They come with pick-up and drop sound.
The rupees do not collide with players, but are still useable as normal physics-entities.

You can visit this addon's [workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1234633466) to install it.
