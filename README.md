# Functional Rupees

These are 5 fully functional and collectable rupees from The Legend of Zelda.

When you touch them, they'll give you the corresponding amount of rupees they would give you in game as health (1 for green, 5 for blue, 20 for red, 100 for silver and 300 for gold).

Whenever a player or NPC dies, it can drop rupees, depending on it's own maximal health. These dropped rupees will also despawn after some time, with a neat animation.
Rupees can also give armor instead of health.
You can configure all these settings under the "Options" tab in the upper-right corner of the spawnmenu, under "Stuff", "Functional Rupees".

They come with pick-up and drop sound.
The rupees do not collide with players, are easy to collect, but are still useable as normal physics-entities.
